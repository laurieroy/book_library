# Book Library - WIP

This is a rails app showing a book library. 

My plan is:
A logged-in user can:
* add books to their library
* Book will have Title & Author at a minimum ? ISBN
	* can optionally have a thumbnail (default otherwise), review, plot description, tags, whether physical or digital, location of book
* comment on them, 
* review them
* suggest to friends
